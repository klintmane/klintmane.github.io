          My name is Klint and you just discovered my secret lair on the
          internet. I'm a software developer by profession, currently living in
          Tirana, Albania&nbsp;
          <em>(a small country in Europe)</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work as a <em>Software Engineer</em> at&nbsp;
          <a href="//airfind.com/">Airfind</a> and am mainly responsible for its
          web clients. Its current stack consists mostly of React & Node.
        </p>

          I could talk your ear off about my profession, although I would prefer
          not to. I admire complex software that is expressed simply and strive
          to always keep that in mind when writing code. I hate unnecessary
          abstractions and often find myself peeking under the hood and
          rewriting things recreationally.
