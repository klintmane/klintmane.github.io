# klintmane.github.io

My personal website and static blog hosted on Github Pages.
This is **NOT** intended for anything else other than being used as a personal site, but feel free to fork it anytime.


## The site uses

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap (Including compiled javascript plugins)
- Animate.css


## How to use

I believe this is pretty self-explanatory considering it is a static site. Just get the project and put it wherever you want.

## Project hierarchy

Two main pages on the root directory (index.html & blog.html).

The ./resources folder contains everything except the blog posts. Since this is a static blog I have made every post a seperate html file.
The posts are all located in the ./posts folder.

The ./resources/css folder contains the css files :
- Two minified (bootstrap.min.css & animate.min.css)
- style.css (main .css file used for styling the website)
- textmorph.css (used on the homepage for the changing text animation under my name)

**Note:** I should probably mention that bootstrap.min.css is responsible for much of the styling and is not the vanilla bootstrap file.
You can get it here : (https://bootswatch.com/readable)

The ./resources/js and ./resources/fonts folder both contain bootstrap content.

The./resources/font-awesome is the Font Awesome folder left untouched.


I think that is all.
