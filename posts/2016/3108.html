                    <p>This will either be a long post or a really short one.</p>
                    <p>Saying goodbye to your past projects is never really simple and doing so while remaining objective is sometimes impossible. During these past years I have been many things and I have grown many times. It has been a crazy, emotional
                        and intensive ride to say the least.</p>

                    <h2>The Student</h2>
                    <p>Since an early age some stuff came to me naturally. I guess that probably is the reason I found myself studying Telecom Engineering at University. However unknown to me was how much studying C would fuel up my love for programming
                        which was undernourished since my high school years when I would casually tinker with web development and scripting. Things kind of took off from there and I went on to develop small applications using C# and WinForms.</p>

                    <h2>The Game Developer</h2>
                    <p>In 2014 my love for programming and interactive art led me to the Unity Game Engine. C#? Check. Love for videogames? Double-Check. So I went on and tried developing some personal projects featured below.</p>

                    <p>Experimenting is good but after I was done with it I decided to join a real team and found myself working for Mediarea Trust s.l.r, an italian company developing Virtual Reality apps and games using Unity and the Vuforia Framework.
                    </p>
                    <p> I really enjoyed working there but unfortunately my stay was not long, as my degree required extra effort.</p>

                    <h2>The Software Engineer</h2>
                    <p>In 2015 I started working as a Software Engineer at one of the leading companies in Albania. BNT Electronics is kind of a big deal here and possibly a partner of a quarter of the foreign companies operating in Albania in the IT sector,
                        Servers&Storage, Fiscal Devices, Printers&Copiers, Medical Equipments etc. You will find that in small markets partnerships and divergence are a big thing.</p>
                    <p> With all that said I was the and still am at the time of this writing responsible for its software department and related projects. I have used various technologies during the process and have learned a bit of everything from programming
                        languages to servers and networking. Lately we have been deploying an Enterprise Information Management (EIM) and Document Management Solution (DMS) called M-Files to a bunch of government institutions and more. We have also previously
                        worked in Java and Android and we are currently preparing to deploy a big Java solution which I fear I cannot disclose.</p>
                    <p> In May 2016 I was part of a partner meeting in Nice which was something new for me and I was a representative of the company I work for and my country.</p>

                    <h2>The Co-Founder</h2>
                    <p>2014 however was not the end of my journey developing games. As a side project in 2016, together with my girlfriend we decided to start an independent game development company called Oursmthing Games.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>You can find it under <a href="http://oursmthing.com">http://oursmthing.com</a> if the domain is still active. We worked real hard and loved every moment of it but we lacked funding and a real team.</p>
                    <p> Our main project was called Coffee Stains and was a fast-paced coffee shop simulator. I was the main developer and designer.</p>

                    <p>We also had a future project planned which would have been an atmospheric interactive adventure game.</p>

                    <h2>The Returning Student</h2>
                    <p>After we decided to put our personal projects to rest, I decided it was time to pursue more professional ones so I went back to dedicating myself fully to Software Engineering and started studying more about the Android SDK and Java.
                        That led me to backend development and after trying out both Java EE and the Spring Framework I decided to walk a different path and embrace Javascript and Node.js.</p>
                    <p> They were a pleasant surprise and a breath of fresh air and I can safely say that Javascript has got me intrigued and I will be exploring it to its depths. Together with Node it has until now introduced me to a plethora of new technologies
                        and tools (npm, NoSQL / Mongo & Mongoose, Express.js and probably a dozen of other interesting stuff).</p>

                    <h2>The Future</h2>
                    <p>Everyone someday has to learn to let go of the past and learn from it. Now I think is my turn to do so and turn my gaze to the future. I want to improve as a person and as a Software Engineer and plan on following through.</p>
                    <p>Till next time,</p>
                    <p>Your Past.</p>
